So reason to recall you qualify for a 20% discount that if maybe in a position to secure your account you'll have to pay $24,283.32. The 20% discount is very till the 28 April. So what I do is I drop it, maybe I get money. Okay. I don't know really if they're going to buy how many pictures of mine, but around the fourth of next month, I don't know if I have some money. Can I do that? You want me to activate that discount for you? I'll try and see if I cannot get money that's th next month. Okay. Yes. Okay. So you're saying I should activate a discount that later is going to make a payment on the fifth, right? Not on the fifth. You're going to be able to cycle this account after March. Sorry?

The discount is feed each and every month. So for this month of since you're saying we cannot afford to cycle the whole balance, then we have to make a monthly installment that we can afford to pay for now and then in March, if maybe you'll be in a position to cycle, then we're going to activate the discount for you in March.

I don't have any money with me yet. I'm only depending on the money that I hope to get on the equation next month. So you're saying you can't afford to pay even if it's on this account by month and February? By month and February. It's going to be tough because month and February. I'm preparing for this because the thing is, Mr. Makuba, if you're going to skip a month without making payments on this account, you will be putting your name address whereby you might find yourself being used certain credit Bureau as a PayPal special arrangement for you for this month of pay that equates to pay minimum that you will be able to afford yeah, but 200 is tough for me so how much can afford to pay in this account by month and February so you're going to make that cash payment directly at absurd or you can make a payment using the standard bank details that I will send them to you via SMS and then remember that by you paying your account monthly that will include your APC profile to be updated positive so that in future it won't be difficult for you to get a credit anyway.

In regards to when we be able to pay the outstanding amount, sir? Ma'am, I'm trying to pay last week, but I don't know what's happening. I don't know what's happening with my card because I went into the bank. Now, they told me it's going to be a charge when I pay direct to the cashier. They say I must go outside. Yes. And then I went outside. They said I must just put the car and then what is called account number. Just put the card and then follow the steps. I've done that. But my card, I don't know if it's blocked or something like that. They supposed to assist you at the branch to make the payment because you can do the payment either at the branch. You can do it at the ATM or as an EFT payment will transfer to the check account. Yeah. The reason why they didn't help, they say the charge is going to be high like the transaction. So my problem is that my card was not working outside because I was going to say, did you go into the branch and let them check for you? What the reason is? Why couldn't the payment be made? No, it was later. I'm planning to go tomorrow again to make an amount because I promised that now I couldn't fulfill my promise that I'm going to pay last week but tomorrow and then I have to sort the car first and then if it's okay, then I can pay outside or I can then pay inside and then they'll charge me what you call those charges.

So I'm going to pay 200 rent. And then again I'll see at the end of the month I can pay another 200, but definitely tomorrow I'm going. Yeah, because I went in for them to cancel some of the what's called the debit order, but it seems they didn't want it to accumulate. So then you just let them also stop the debit orders on the account as well. I did try but last week it shows that it's still functioning because it shows that how did they do that and they'll be able to even check for the reason why the account you cannot make a payment on the check account so in letting also just check your card for you and then regarding the debit orders as well yes I will check with them tomorrow okay remember that apps is also required to update your credit profile so late insured payments can also affect your relationship with apps or bank is there any other number we can call you on Besides this number? No but my wife is far away only that's fine okay can you please provide me with your physical address if SMS and notifications regarding the account as long as it appears and apps is also required to update your credit profile so paying later short payments can also affect your relationship with apps bank so then tomorrow then you pay the amount which will be the 200 and if you'll be able to pay more you can do so as well yes okay.

I need to use it, but the charges remember, with the check account, there's monthly fee, but charges that needs to be paid. And also if you do have a debit order on the account and there's no funds in the account, remember, you'll be charged for that failed debit order. That could be that's why the account is accumulating so much. So you just need to go to the branch and just check with them again, sir. Okay, so how will you be doing the payment? Will you be an EFT payment at the APM or will you pay it by David branch? Okay. And is this your number we should call you on? Yes. Okay, let me just say that. Remember also, sir, that is required to update your credit profile. So paying later short payments can also affect your credit profile. So then on Friday, then you do the payment and then you pay it at the branch. But if you're able to pay it before that, you can do so as well. Okay? Okay. Thanks for your time and you enjoy your day.

      "Hello. Hello, can I speak to Mr. Moshana? Yeah, speaking. I am Rebecca from Mbd on behalf of ASA bank. Ok, the registered credit provider and a resident financial adviser. Yes. Calls are recorded for quality and legal purpose. For security of your information, can I have your date of birth, please? What is your physical address? Can I have your work telephone number? I'm not working on my banking. The check account for absorb bank is on areas. So then at which branch did you open your check account, sir? The name. When was the last payment you made? Last week. Last week? Yeah, I deposited an amount of because I received an SMS saying I'm in August of 118. Okay, so that SMS was up until the month of January. Are you aware? No, I was not aware. Okay, yes, it was for the month of January. So the bank fees for February has been actually put in this account. So there's 68 range for the month of February. Okay. Are you still using the card, sir? Yeah. Okay, so can I clarify this when I'm saying are you still using the card? I'm asking about the money coming in. But now, if there's no money coming in the account, then the account is not. You're not using it. So that is why it will keep on accumulating monthly bank first. So it's better that if you settle the 68 rent, then you close the account. Okay? Yes. So that it cannot accumulate for March again. Okay, so then is it possible that you can pay tomorrow the 68th? Okay, no, it's not a problem. If you can reach that place tomorrow, it's fine. Today, it's okay, you can pay it. But if you cannot reach the place, then you can pay it by tomorrow. So that is payable at the bank as a settlement amount. So it's better you go to the bank because if you close the account, you need to talk to the bank so that when you go inside the bank, you pay the 68 rent, then you talk to the person that will help you that you want to close the account because you don't have any money getting inside there. How do you get your pension money? You get it from this check account? No, not from that or the other one. Yeah. Okay, then you need to close this one, sir, because the accumulation of this is going to happen every month. So go inside the bank and make the payment. So what we are going to do is that we are going to wait for you until Thursday. Okay. Tomorrow, if you pay today, you put it today, but make sure that by tomorrow the account is closed. Okay. Then if it is closed, then on Thursday the payment will show. Then we'll know that you have made the payment for the 68th. Okay, so. But I'm failing to pay it will keep on increasing more and more because you don't pay. And now it's going to actually make the relationship between you and outside a bad position, then. Okay.

After the 5 March. Yeah, but all I'm saying, ma'am, but it will depend on the exhibition that I'm going to if I'm going to raise. Okay. No, it's not a problem, Mr. Makubo. The discount is feed each and every month. So for this month of since you're saying we cannot afford to cycle the whole balance, then we have to make a monthly installment that we can afford to pay for now and then in March, if maybe you'll be in a position to cycle, then we're going to activate the discount for you in March. But then for February we need you to pay at least the minimum installment on this account. Yeah, but now the problem is at the moment as I'm talking to you, I'm not working. I don't have any money with me yet. I'm only depending on the money that I hope to get on the equation next month. So you're saying you can't afford to pay even if it's on this account by month and February? By month and February. It's going to be tough because month and February. I'm preparing for this because the thing is, Mr. Makuba, if you're going to skip a month without making payments on this account, you will be putting your name address whereby you might find yourself being used certain credit Bureau as a PayPal special arrangement for you for this month of pay that equates to pay minimum that you will be able to afford yeah, but 200 is tough for me so how much can afford to pay in this account by month and February so you're going to make that cash payment directly at absurd or you can make a payment using the standard bank details that I will send them to you via SMS and then remember that by you paying your account monthly that will include your APC profile to be updated positive so that in future it won't be difficult for you to get a credit anyway. Yeah, but that will be for February. You need to put that money around which date? That should be the latest by then I know I'll make it to be the latest on the 7 March then yes I'm going to send you the details. Okay. Thank you. Any questions regarding the account? No question. It's just that I'm not waiting. That's my only worry at the moment but the situation is going all right. Thank you so much for your time and then you are going to make a payment directly. Thank you. Thank you so much for your time. Enjoy your day. Bye.\n",

How did you mean? What? If you're going to keep on failing to pay your account monthly, you are going to put your name at risk whereby you might find yourself being listed on credit Bureau as a bad paying customer.

So how much can you afford to pay monthly on this account? So you have to pay at least $100.\n",
